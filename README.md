The application was developed to serve 3 main purposes:
1) Indian Sign Language to Text with captioning for words
2) Speech to ISL - Generate a video that shows the corresponding sign language for the sentence
3) Text to Lip Movement Generator - Given a word, create an avatar that shows the lip movement for the word
